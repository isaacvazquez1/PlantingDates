	abstract = {Productivity of arable lands highly depends on the management techniques and their timing. Climate change urges the need for adaptive management tools, such as methods for optimization of planting date (PD). In existing crop models PD is usually specified by the user as a fixed date or through a set of rules which depend on diverse environmental conditions. However, validated rules of PD calculation are rare in the existing literature. In this study we strived to develop methods that could reliably estimate the PDs based on soil temperature and soil moisture, as well as to provide tool for PD projections under climate change. PD data from 294 agricultural enterprises in Hungary during the period from 2001 to 2010 were used to validate the PD methods. Effect of climate change on the timing of PD was evaluated using an ensemble of 10 climate change projections. Meteorological and soil data were obtained from the Open Database for Climate Change Related Impact Studies in Central Europe (FORESEE) and Soil and Terrain (SOTER) databases. The 4M crop model was used for crop yield simulations. Relative to the present day conditions, our analysis predicts a shift to earlier PDs for maize (approx. 12 days) and later PD for winter wheat (approx. 17 days) for the 2071–2100 period. The results indicated that maize PDs should be changed according to the earlier start of the growing season in spring. In contrast, currently used PDs should be preserved for winter wheat to avoid climate change related yield loss. Our analyses showed that the proposed PD estimation methods performed better than other eight tested methods. The advantage of our novel rules is that they could be applied for other crop models, as well.}

	abstract = {The soil-plant-atmosphere nexus is vital in terrestrial ecosystems, featuring complex feedback loops that link soil, plant, and atmospheric processes. This review analyzes the significant impacts of climate change on the soil-plant-atmosphere nexus, focusing on soil degradation, plant physiological responses, and atmospheric alterations. This comprehensive review aims to integrate current research, evaluate interdependent feedback mechanisms, and highlight the gaps in understanding the system's resilience under climatic stressors. A systematic literature analysis was done by focusing on 1) soil-plant-atmosphere nexus, 2) climate change impacts on soil dynamics, 3) climate stressors and plant responses, and 4) soil-plant-atmosphere feedback mechanisms, with specific criteria for data on extreme weather events, changed nutrient cycles, and CO2-related alterations and temperature-related changes. Key findings reveal that climate-induced disruptions such as altered precipitation, increased temperatures, and extreme weather events weaken soil structure, damage nutrient cycling, and modify plant growth, thereby threatening agricultural productivity and ecosystem stability. Elevated CO2 enhances photosynthesis but is counterbalanced by nutrient limitations and phenological mismatches affecting biodiversity. Feedback loops, such as those driven by decreased carbon sequestration and increased greenhouse gas emissions, amplify these effects. The review emphasizes the urgency of integrated mitigation and adaptation strategies, including the adoption of climate-resilient agricultural practices, urban green infrastructure, and renewable energy technologies.}

	abstract="Micronutrients are essential for plant growth although required in only very small amounts. There are eight micronutrients needed for healthy growth of wheat: chlorine, iron, boron, manganese, zinc, copper, nickel and molybdenum. Several factors will influence the availability of micronutrients, including levels in the soil, and mobility or availability. Zinc deficiency is the most significant problem globally followed by boron, molybdenum, copper, manganese and iron. Deficiency is usually addressed through application of nutrients to seeds, or through foliar spays when symptoms develop. There is considerable genetic variation in the efficiency of micronutrient uptake in wheat, but this is not a major selection target for breeding programs given the agronomic solutions. However, for some micronutrients, the concentrations in the soil can be very high and result in toxicity. Of the micronutrients, the narrowest range between deficiency and toxicity is for boron and toxicity is a significant problem in some regions. Although not a micronutrient, aluminium toxicity is also a major factor limiting yield in many areas, usually associated with a low soil pH. Agronomic solutions for boron and aluminium toxicity are difficult and expensive. Consequently, genetic approaches have dominated the strategies for addressing toxicity and good sources of tolerance are available.",

	abstract = {Abstract Global environmental change will cause shifts in species communities, with non-native species likely replacing native ones at an unprecedented rate. This will have consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services, in addition to the ecological and economic damage caused by those non-native species that are invasive. Understanding general patterns driving distributions of native and non-native species is therefore vital, but no study has compared yet whether environmental variables that correlate with a species' presence differ between the two groups other than at local scale and often with very limited sample size. In this study, we focus on 141 native and non-native congeneric plant species pairs at the scale of Switzerland. In the framework of correlative species distribution models, we used newly developed methods for efficient automated selection of a parsimonious number of predictor environmental variables to determine which ones, out of a large candidate set in eight classes, have the strongest explanatory power for both species groups. Our results indicated that variables influence the two groups in significantly different ways. Climate was by far the strongest determinant of both native and non-native species distributions, although it had significantly more explanatory power in native species models. Models for non-native species were significantly more influenced by anthropogenic factors, land use variables and forest cover. The presence of non-native species was also associated with habitats with a significantly lower mean naturality value than native species. These findings provide novel empirical evidence for the different environmental factors driving native and non-native plants' distributions and guidance for non-native species management. Practical implications: species distribution models are an increasingly frequently advised tool for conservation management and our results provide guidelines on which covariates should be specifically considered to assess the habitat suitability of non-native versus native species. The distributions of the former group of species are particularly important to research, as, in time, they may turn invasive. In addition, areas close to infrastructure should be scanned regularly for incipient colonizations by non-native species, especially in as yet uninvaded areas, such as high mountains.},

Such context dependency implies that the speed, persistence, and ubiquity of anthropogenic habitat alterations may suddenly put even previously well-adapted native species at a competitive disadvantage with non-native species. That is, anthropogenic disturbance may so drastically alter environments that a native species finds itself in an environment that in key ways is just as novel as it is to a non-indigenous species. Extreme disturbances may thereby erase a native species’ prior advantage of local environmental adaptation accrued during its long-term incumbency over evolutionary time. I document examples from two areas of dramatic human alteration of selection regimes – eutrophication and the selective removal of top predators – that support this mechanism. Additionally, I highlight ways in which this mechanism is experimentally testable. Alteration of selection regimes may prove to be a powerful explanation for the enhanced success and impact of biological invasions in our globally disturbed biosphere.},

	abstract = {Abstract Climate change and biological invasions are primary threats to global biodiversity that may interact in the future. To date, the hypothesis that climate change will favour non-native species has been examined exclusively through local comparisons of single or few species. Here, we take a meta-analytical approach to broadly evaluate whether non-native species are poised to respond more positively than native species to future climatic conditions. We compiled a database of studies in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems that reported performance measures of non-native (157 species) and co-occurring native species (204 species) under different temperature, CO2 and precipitation conditions. Our analyses revealed that in terrestrial (primarily plant) systems, native and non-native species responded similarly to environmental changes. By contrast, in aquatic (primarily animal) systems, increases in temperature and CO2 largely inhibited native species. There was a general trend towards stronger responses among non-native species, including enhanced positive responses to more favourable conditions and stronger negative responses to less favourable conditions. As climate change proceeds, aquatic systems may be particularly vulnerable to invasion. Across systems, there could be a higher risk of invasion at sites becoming more climatically hospitable, whereas sites shifting towards harsher conditions may become more resistant to invasions.},

	abstract = {Summary
	Global environmental changes caused by natural and human activities have accelerated in the past 200 years. The increase in greenhouse gases is predicted to continue to raise global temperature and change water availability in the 21st century. In this Review, we explore the profound effect the environment has on plant diseases — a susceptible host will not be infected by a virulent pathogen if the environmental conditions are not conducive for disease. The change in CO2 concentrations, temperature, and water availability can have positive, neutral, or negative effects on disease development, as each disease may respond differently to these variations. However, the concept of disease optima could potentially apply to all pathosystems. Plant resistance pathways, including pattern-triggered immunity to effector-triggered immunity, RNA interference, and defense hormone networks, are all affected by environmental factors. On the pathogen side, virulence mechanisms, such as the production of toxins and virulence proteins, as well as pathogen reproduction and survival are influenced by temperature and humidity. For practical reasons, most laboratory investigations into plant–pathogen interactions at the molecular level focus on well-established pathosystems and use a few static environmental conditions that capture only a fraction of the dynamic plant–pathogen–environment interactions that occur in nature. There is great need for future research to increasingly use dynamic environmental conditions in order to fully understand the multidimensional nature of plant–pathogen interactions and produce disease-resistant crop plants that are resilient to climate change.}

	abstract = {Avian pollination is thought to be less prevalent and less at risk than avian seed-dispersal. The extent of recently revealed bird pollination that does not conform to the classic ornithophily-nectarivore template suggests this mutualism may be cryptic and more prevalent than considered to date. Widespread anthropogenic disturbance has disproportionately impacted the connections between birds and flowers, so that bird pollination may be systematically under-reported. Evidence suggests that where plants are visited by more than one pollinator guild, the relative effectiveness of birds is high compared to invertebrates. In the absence of replacement, the loss of bird pollinators has resulted in pollination failure, increased inbreeding depression, and decreased plant density. Confirmation of seed limitation in pollen-limited plants serviced by birds provides a precautionary sign of the possible long term effects of bird pollinator loss. The quality of pollination service provided by birds has important consequences for gene flow and offspring survival. Pollen limitation experiments suggest that bird-pollinated plants in New Zealand, the Americas, Southeast Asia, and Africa suffer similar levels of pollen limitation, and are typically more strongly pollen-limited than insect-pollinated plants. Thus, bird-pollination appears to be under-reported, hard to replace and at greater risk of failure than currently assumed.},

In response, insect pollinators show shifts in range and phenology, interactions with plants and other taxa are altered, and in some cases pollination services have diminished. Recent studies show some pollinators are tracking climate change by moving latitudinally and elevationally, while others are not. Shifts in insect pollinator phenology generally keep pace with advances in flowering, although there are exceptions. Recent data demonstrate competition between exotic and native bees, along with rapid positive effects of exotic plant removal on pollinator richness. Genetic analyses tie bee fitness to habitat quality. Across drivers, novel communities are a common outcome that deserves more study.}

	abstract = {It is clear that the majority of flowering plants are pollinated by insects and other animals, with a minority utilising abiotic pollen vectors, mainly wind. However there is no accurate published calculation of the proportion of the ca 352 000 species of angiosperms that interact with pollinators. Widely cited figures range from 67\% to 96\% but these have not been based on firm data. We estimated the number and proportion of flowering plants that are pollinated by animals using published and unpublished community-level surveys of plant pollination systems that recorded whether each species present was pollinated by animals or wind. The proportion of animal-pollinated species rises from a mean of 78\% in temperate-zone communities to 94\% in tropical communities. By correcting for the latitudinal diversity trend in flowering plants, we estimate the global number and proportion of animal pollinated angiosperms as 308 006, which is 87.5\% of the estimated species-level diversity of flowering plants. Given current concerns about the decline in pollinators and the possible resulting impacts on both natural communities and agricultural crops, such estimates are vital to both ecologists and policy makers. Further research is required to assess in detail the absolute dependency of these plants on their pollinators, and how this varies with latitude and community type, but there is no doubt that plant–pollinator interactions play a significant role in maintaining the functional integrity of most terrestrial ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Research quantifying ecosystem services (ES) – collectively, the benefits that society obtains from ecosystems –is rapidly increasing. Despite the seemingly straightforward definition, a wide variety of methods are used to measure ES. This methodological variability has largely been ignored, and standard protocols to select measures that capture ES provision have yet to be established. Furthermore, most published papers do not include explicit definitions of individual ES. We surveyed the literature on pollination ES to assess the range of measurement approaches, focusing on three essential steps: (1) definition of the ES, (2) identification of components contributing to ES delivery, and (3) selection of metrics to represent these components. We found considerable variation in how pollination as an ES – a relatively well-defined service – is measured. We discuss potential causes of this variability and provide suggestions to address this issue. Consistency in ES measurement, or a clear explanation of selected definitions and metrics, is critical to facilitate comparisons among studies and inform ecosystem management.},

	abstract = {Abstract Climate change and invasive species are two of the most important ecological issues facing the world today. Yet, to date these two factors have largely been viewed independently. In order to prevent large-scale economic and environmental damage and as a first step towards predicting and preventing invasions, it is important to understand the factors affecting invasions. Here, we focus on insect herbivores and link the climate change and invasive research fields. We illustrate using existing published research that life history traits can be useful indicators of future invasive potential. However, climate change will also affect propagule pressure and the communities into which invaders will arrive. With the aid of a meta-analysis we show that climate-induced community changes are likely to increase niche-availability in the future, further exacerbating the problem of invasive species. It is timely and important that further research linking these two important ecological threats is undertaken.},

	abstract = {Many of the world’s most important crop pests and disease vectors are small migratory insects that depend upon windborne transport to invade seasonally favorable regions. In East China, atmospheric conditions are generally favorable for bidirectional transport (northward in the spring and southward in the fall) due to wind regimes associated with the spring advance and fall retreat of the East Asian summer monsoon system. However, climate change has delayed the retreat of the monsoon and, in the case of the rice leafroller (RLR) moth, has led to an absence of favorable winds for fall return migrations. Climate change has thus tipped the balance such that migration is now a less favorable strategy for the RLR and potentially many other insects. Many insect migrants rely on favorable seasonal winds to carry out long-range latitudinal migrations. In East China, the annual advance and retreat of the East Asian summer monsoon produces ideal conditions for seasonal range expansion and contraction of many migratory crop pests. However, climate-induced changes in the strength, timing, and location of the monsoon are impacting wind systems which may, in turn, affect migration patterns. We investigated these questions in the rice leafroller (RLR) moth, a severe pest of rice that annually invades the Lower Yangtze River Valley (LYRV) of China from winter-breeding areas further south. Using a 24-y dataset of RLR population dynamics from 31 monitoring stations across Southeast China, we investigated the impact of changes in monsoon wind regimes on fall migration patterns of the pest. Historically, RLR emigrated from the LYRV to South China on the favorably directed winds produced by the retreat of the monsoon at the end of the outbreak season (from mid-August onward). We show that in the recent 12-y period, prevailing late-season winds remain northward for longer than previously, preventing locally produced moths from emigrating southward. Additionally, winds now facilitate mass late-season immigrations into the LYRV, creating an ecological trap, as immigrants do not have time to produce another generation. As a consequence of the changing wind patterns, pest pressure is declining, and climate-induced changes to the East Asian summer monsoon result in seasonal migration becoming a riskier strategy. Such changes in insect migration patterns have severe implications for the population dynamics of windborne migrants, ecosystem functioning, and pest management strategies.}}

The evidence reveals that the likelihood of regime shifts may increase when humans reduce resilience by such actions as removing response diversity, removing whole functional groups of species, or removing whole trophic levels; impacting on ecosystems via emissions of waste and pollutants and climate change; and altering the magnitude, frequency, and duration of disturbance regimes. The combined and often synergistic effects of those pressures can make ecosystems more vulnerable to changes that previously could be absorbed. As a consequence, ecosystems may suddenly shift from desired to less desired states in their capacity to generate ecosystem services. Active adaptive management and governance of resilience will be required to sustain desired ecosystem states and transform degraded ecosystems into fundamentally new and more desirable configurations.",

Deutsch et al. show that this effect may be exacerbated by insect pests (see the Perspective by Riegler). Insects already consume 5 to 20\% of major grain crops. The authors' models show that for the three most important grain crops—wheat, rice, and maize—yield lost to insects will increase by 10 to 25\% per degree Celsius of warming, hitting hardest in the temperate zone. These findings provide an estimate of further potential climate impacts on global food supply and a benchmark for future regional and field-specific studies of crop-pest-climate interactions. Science, this issue p. 916; see also p. 846 Models of insect population growth and metabolism in a warming climate predict losses of major food crops to insect pests. Insect pests substantially reduce yields of three staple grains—rice, maize, and wheat—but models assessing the agricultural impacts of global warming rarely consider crop losses to insects. We use established relationships between temperature and the population growth and metabolic rates of insects to estimate how and where climate warming will augment losses of rice, maize, and wheat to insects. Global yield losses of these grains are projected to increase by 10 to 25\% per degree of global mean surface warming. Crop losses will be most acute in areas where warming increases both population growth and metabolic rates of insects. These conditions are centered primarily in temperate regions, where most grain is produced.}}

There are more than six million species of insect although only 20–30 of these are important pests for major crops.

Although these insect farmers are in some ways quite different from each other, in many more ways they are remarkably similar, suggesting convergent evolution. All propagate their cultivars as clonal monocultures within their nests and, in most cases, clonally across many farmer generations as well. Long-term clonal monoculture presents special problems for disease control, but insect farmers have evolved a combination of strategies to manage crop diseases: They (a) sequester their gardens from the environment; (b) monitor gardens intensively, controlling pathogens early in disease outbreaks; (c) occasionally access population-level reservoirs of genetically variable cultivars, even while propagating clonal monocultures across many farmer generations; and (d) manage, in addition to the primary cultivars, an array of “auxiliary” microbes providing disease suppression and other services. Rather than growing a single cultivar solely for nutrition, insect farmers appear to cultivate, and possibly “artificially select” for, integrated crop-microbe consortia. Indeed, crop domestication in the context of coevolving and codomesticated microbial consortia may explain the 50-million year old agricultural success of insect farmers.",

Some pesticides are toxic both to the targeted pest and the predaceous or parasitic insect that could provide pest control. Alternative pesticides with fewer or no negative effects on the beneficial insect often exist but can be more expensive. Additionally, some beneficial insects are commercially available and can be purchased and released in the field. This paper models the pest control decisions of a grower who utilizes a pesticide and a predaceous insect to control the crop pest and compares these decisions to that of a grower who does not know that the predaceous insect exists. The results show that the latter grower will drive the predator population to zero and will overutilize chemical control. When the predator is known and utilized, the optimal decisions involve entirely mitigating the negative effects of the pesticide as well as releasing additional predators.}

Genotypic selection for adaptation to such environments has already played an important role in agriculture, but the fundamental mechanisms are poorly understood.

Predicted climatic changes through affecting these simultaneously occurring interactions might change the microclimate surrounding plants, plants' susceptibility, the range of host microorganisms (i.e., symbionts or pathogens), and their simultaneous interaction with plants. The influence of climate change on interactions between environmental stresses and plants can lead to positive or negative impacts of one stress on the others and cause changes in strategies adopted by plants---either negative (i.e., susceptibility) or positive (i.e., tolerance)---thus causing modifications of primary and secondary metabolism of plants. Primary metabolism plays a key role in plants' adaptive/defense response through the influence on the modulation of secondary metabolism and the activation of the host's various defense mechanisms. Alterations in primary and secondary metabolism might include changes in the availability of nutrients, metabolically active compounds, or in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism and C/N balance.",

	ABSTRACT = {Agriculture and climate change are internally correlated with each other in various aspects, as climate change is the main cause of biotic and abiotic stresses, which have adverse effects on the agriculture of a region. The land and its agriculture are being affected by climate changes in different ways, e.g., variations in annual rainfall, average temperature, heat waves, modifications in weeds, pests or microbes, global change of atmospheric CO2 or ozone level, and fluctuations in sea level. The threat of varying global climate has greatly driven the attention of scientists, as these variations are imparting negative impact on global crop production and compromising food security worldwide. According to some predicted reports, agriculture is considered the most endangered activity adversely affected by climate changes. To date, food security and ecosystem resilience are the most concerning subjects worldwide. Climate-smart agriculture is the only way to lower the negative impact of climate variations on crop adaptation, before it might affect global crop production drastically. In this review paper, we summarize the causes of climate change, stresses produced due to climate change, impacts on crops, modern breeding technologies, and biotechnological strategies to cope with climate change, in order to develop climate resilient crops. Revolutions in genetic engineering techniques can also aid in overcoming food security issues against extreme environmental conditions, by producing transgenic plants.},

    abstract = { The effect of storage temperature on the shelf life, weight loss, respiration rate                and ethylene production of Hass avocado (Persea americana Mill) was studied. Two                batches of green mature avocado fruits, classified as ‘‘super                extra’’ were stored at 10 and 20 C (first batch) and at 7 and 25                C (second batch). The avocado shelf lives were 22, 8, 32 and 6 days at 10, 20, 7 and                25 C, respectively. Based on the data of the first assay Q10 was calculated as 2.75,                with this value the predicted shelf life at 7 and 25 C were 29.8 and 4.8 days,                respectively. That meant shelf life was underestimated 7 and 20\% at 7 and 25 C,                respectively. Weight loss was linear at both the storage temperatures, it was 4.3\%                in fruits at 20 C for 8 days and 3.0\% at 10 C for 22 days. The maximum CO2                production at 20 C was reached during the second day of storage, while at 10 C it                was reached at the 17th day (176.17 15.98 and 74.73 7.32 mL/kg h, respectively). The                maximum ethylene production at 20 C was reached the second day of storage, and at 10                C the 6th day (239.06 54.55 and 28.00 8.12 mL/kg h, respectively). }

abstract = {Abstract How long will the four seasons be by 2100? Increasing evidence suggests that the length of a single season or in regional scales has changed under global warming, but a hemispherical-scale response of the four seasons in the past and future remains unknown. We find that summer in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes has lengthened, whereas winter has shortened, owing to shifts in their onsets and withdrawals, accompanied by shorter spring and autumn. Such changes in lengths and onsets can be mainly attributed to greenhouse-warming. Even if the current warming rate does not accelerate, changes in seasons will still be exacerbated in the future. Under the business-as-usual scenario, summer is projected to last nearly half a year, but winter less than 2 months by 2100. The changing seasonal clock signifies disturbed agriculture seasons and rhythm of species activities, more frequent heat waves, storms and wildfires, amounting to increased risks to humanity.},
